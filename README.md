# Group Tabs and Share
Our story is of four enthusiastic hackers who’ve hopped onto Microsoft Edge’s transformation journey! <br> 

Imagine a situation where you’re surfing the internet to plan your dream vacation. <br>You found some amazing hotel deals and want to share the links with your family. 
Wouldn’t it be nice if you didn’t have to manually copy-paste-share each link? <br>


What if you could share the links on your family group with just a click of a button?<br> Let’s suppose you’re troubleshooting a customer issue. 
You did a rigorous research and found a number of useful online articles that led you to the resolution. You want to share these articles with your customer. <br>


Isn’t it frustrating to copy each link one by one?<br>

What if we told you that we’ve written an Edge Chromium extension that could do some magic here?<br>

Presenting “Group Tabs and Share”… With this extension you can select the links you want to share, choose a format, choose a platform, and share away 😊
